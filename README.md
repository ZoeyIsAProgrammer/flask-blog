# Flask Blog Project
Introduction:  
This is a simple blog website built with Flask, where you can register, login, logout a user, create, update, delete and view blogs.  

Technologies I used in this project:  
Flask  
Flask blueprint structure (to separate views into main function views and auth-ralated views)  
Flask-Bootstrap  
Flask-Login  
Flask-SQLAlchemy  
Flask-WTF  
Flask-Migrate  
Sqlite3
